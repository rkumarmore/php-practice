Strategy pattern makes a family algorithm and encapsulates each algorithm.
Here each algorithm should be inter-changeable within the family.


$elements = array(
array(
'id' => 2,
'date' => '2011-01-01',
),
array(
'id' => 1,
'date' => '2011-02-01'
)
);

$collection = new ObjectCollection($elements);

$collection->setComparator(new IdComparator());
$collection->sort();

echo "Sorted by ID:\n";
print_r($collection->elements);

$collection->setComparator(new DateComparator());
$collection->sort();

echo "Sorted by date:\n";
print_r($collection->elements);


<?php
$elements = array(
    array(
        'id' => 2,
        'date' => '2011-01-01',
    ),
    array(
        'id' => 1,
        'date' => '2011-02-01'
    )
);

$collection = new ObjectCollection($elements);

$collection->setComparator(new IdComparator());
$collection->sort();

echo "Sorted by ID:\n";
print_r($collection->elements);

$collection->setComparator(new DateComparator());
$collection->sort();

echo "Sorted by date:\n";
print_r($collection->elements);
?>

With the strategy pattern you encapsulate specific families of algorithms allowing the client class responsible for instantiating a particular algorithm to have no knowledge of the actual implementation. There are several variations on the strategy pattern, the simplest of which is outlined below:

This first code snippet outlines a family of algorithms; you may want a serialized array, some JSON or maybe just an array of data:



interface OutputInterface
{
public function load();
}

class SerializedArrayOutput implements OutputInterface
{
public function load()
{
return serialize($arrayOfData);
}
}

class JsonStringOutput implements OutputInterface
{
public function load()
{
return json_encode($arrayOfData);
}
}

class ArrayOutput implements OutputInterface
{
public function load()
{
return $arrayOfData;
}
}
By encapsulating the above algorithms you are making it nice and clear in your code that other developers can easily add new output types without affecting the client code.

You will see how each concrete ‘output’ class implements an OutputInterface - this serves two purposes, primarily it provides a simple contract which must be obeyed by any new concrete implementations. Secondly by implementing a common interface you will see in the next section that you can now utilise Type Hinting to ensure that the client which is utilising these behaviours is of the correct type in this case ‘OutputInterface’.

The next snippet of code outlines how a calling client class might use one of these algorithms and even better set the behaviour required at runtime:

class SomeClient
{
private $output;

public function setOutput(OutputInterface $outputType)
{
$this->output = $outputType;
}

public function loadOutput()
{
return $this->output->load();
}
}
The calling client class above has a private property which must be set at runtime and be of type ‘OutputInterface’ once this property is set a call to loadOutput() will call the load() method in the concrete class of the output type that has been set.

$client = new SomeClient();

// Want an array?
$client->setOutput(new ArrayOutput());
$data = $client->loadOutput();

// Want some JSON?
$client->setOutput(new JsonStringOutput());
$data = $client->loadOutput();
