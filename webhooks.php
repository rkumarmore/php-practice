	<h5>Webhook</h5>
	A webhook (also called a web callback or HTTP push API) is a way for an app to provide other applications with real-time information. A webhook delivers data to other applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediately.

	<h5>Callback</h5>
	A callback function is executed after the current effect is 100% finished.
